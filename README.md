# ENPM661 â€“ Planning for Autonomous Robots

# Project 2 : Implementation-of-the-Dijkstra-Algorithm-for-a-Point-Robot

## A. File Structure

This projects consists of the following code files
+ Projection Description
+ Code file
+ Output video fle
+ Code in pdf format

## B. Modification to the given dataset/video/image:
- None

## C. Dependancies

+ Ensure the following depenancies are installed
    ```
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

## D. Running the Program

+ For viewing a animated plot, set 'anim_flag = True' at Line Number: 9 in the code.
+ Run the program "dijkstra_arshad_shaik.py" to check the outputs.
    ```
    python3 dijkstra_arshad_shaik.py
    ```
+ Provide x input in the range of [0,600] and y input from [0,250]
+ The origin is considered as bottom left as shown in the figure below

## E. Results
+ On running each of the proframs, the output genrated map with start point and goal point are shown, if the points are not in obstacle space.
+ Few sanpshots of the output maps are attached for reference.
